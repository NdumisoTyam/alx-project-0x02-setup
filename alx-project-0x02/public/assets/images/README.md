# Image Assets Directory

This folder contains static image assets used throughout the ALX Project Setup 0x02.

## Guidelines

- Only include optimized images (e.g., compressed PNG, JPEG, SVG).
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g., `hero-banner.png`, `logo-dark.svg`).
- Avoid spaces or special characters in filenames.
- Group related images by feature or layout if needed.

## Usage

Images in this folder are publicly accessible via the `/assets/images/` path.
Example: `/assets/images/logo.png` can be referenced in your code as:

  <img src="/assets/images/logo.png" alt="Project Logo" />

## Licensing

Ensure all images are either:
- Created by project contributors
- Licensed for free commercial use
- Properly attributed if required

## Notes

- Do not store temporary or unused images here.
- Consider using SVGs for icons and logos when possible.
